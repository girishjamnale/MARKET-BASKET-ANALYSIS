# MARKET-BASKET-ANALYSIS

MARKET Basket Analysis (MBA) is an association analysis and is a popular data mining technique. Itâ€™s a kind of knowledge discovery in data (KDD) and this technique can be applied in various fields of work. In market basket analysis (also called association analysis or frequent itemset mining), you analyze purchases that commonly happen together. For example, people who buy bread and peanut butter also buy jelly. Or people who buy shampoo might also buy conditioner. What relationships there are between items is the target of the analysis. Knowing what your customers tend to buy together can help with marketing efforts and store/website layout. Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy. The discovery of these associations can help retailers develop marketing strategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers. The strategies may include: Changing the store layout according to trends Customer behavior analysis Catalog design Cross marketing on online stores What are the trending items customers buy Customized emails with add-on sales etc.
